            <h1>Hobbies</h1>

            <p>Among my hobbies are illustration and digital painting. This drawing was the final assignment in a Figure Drawing class that I took a few years ago. We were tasked with creating a self-portrait in the style of Edgar Degas' pastel portraits.</p>

            <p>Additionally, I enjoy reading, film and television, and occasionally videos games.</p>

            <p>I am also slowly collecting the first 30 years of <em>X-Men</em> comics, which I grew up reading.</p>
